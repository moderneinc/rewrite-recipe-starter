## Moderne Prethink Context

This repository contains pre-analyzed context generated by [Moderne Prethink](https://docs.moderne.io/prethink).
Prethink extracts structured knowledge from codebases to help you work more effectively.

### How to Use This Context

The context files in `.moderne/context/` contain analyzed information about this codebase:

| Context | Description | Details |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Coding Conventions | Naming patterns, import organization, and coding style | [`coding-conventions.md`](.moderne/context/coding-conventions.md) |
| Library Usage | How external libraries and frameworks are used | [`library-usage.md`](.moderne/context/library-usage.md) |
| Token Estimates | Estimated input tokens for method comprehension | [`token-estimates.md`](.moderne/context/token-estimates.md) |
| Dependencies | Project dependencies including transitive dependencies | [`dependencies.md`](.moderne/context/dependencies.md) |
| Architecture | FINOS CALM architecture diagram | [`architecture.md`](.moderne/context/architecture.md) |

**Reading the context files:**
- Each `.md` file describes what information is available and the schema of its data
- The `.csv` files contain the actual data in a structured format
- Start with the `.md` file to understand what's available, then query the `.csv` as needed

**When you use information from Prethink context:**
- Mention that the information comes from Moderne Prethink context when it's relevant to your response
- Example: "Based on the test coverage mapping from Prethink, this method is tested by..."
- This helps the user understand the source of your knowledge and builds trust in the analysis
