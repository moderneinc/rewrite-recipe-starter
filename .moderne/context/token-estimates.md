# Token Estimates

## Estimated input tokens for method comprehension

Estimated input token counts that would be sent to an LLM for method comprehension. Use this to estimate AI costs before enabling code comprehension. Descriptions and techniques are left blank.

## Data Tables

### Method descriptions

**File:** [`method-descriptions.csv`](method-descriptions.csv)

AI-generated descriptions of methods in the codebase with inference time and token usage metrics.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Source path | The path to the source file containing the method. |
| Class name | The fully qualified name of the class containing the method. |
| Signature | The method signature including parameter types. |
| Checksum | SHA-256 checksum of the method source code for cache validation. |
| Description | AI-generated description of what the method does. |
| Return value description | AI-generated description of what the method returns. |
| Technique 1 | First programming technique or pattern used in the method. |
| Technique 2 | Second programming technique or pattern used in the method. |
| Technique 3 | Third programming technique or pattern used in the method. |
| Inference time (ms) | Time taken for the LLM to generate the description, in milliseconds. |
| Input tokens | Number of tokens in the input prompt sent to the LLM. |
| Output tokens | Number of tokens in the response generated by the LLM. |
